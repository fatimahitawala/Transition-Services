1.	Purpose of the document
This document outlines the functional requirements of the Back-office Portal to support key business 
operations related to tenancy lifecycle management. It focuses on enabling operational efficiency and 
consistency for the following core functionalities:
*	Move-in: Facilitates the onboarding of new tenants or owners into a unit or property.
*	Account Renewal: Manages the periodic renewal process for active accounts, ensuring 
continuity of services and compliance.
*	Move-out: Handles the formal exit process of a tenant or owner from a unit, including final 
settlements and service deactivation.
These functionalities are essential to ensure seamless coordination between internal teams and external 
stakeholders, while maintaining data accuracy, SLA compliance, and transparency across the customer 
journey.

Functional Specification under BRD FM-04 Move-In:
*	FS-15: Move-In Creation

user (Owner, tenant, HHO-Owner, HHO-Company).
As per the new requirement, move-in request will be processed in OneSobha back-office portal. Along 
with this, Community Admin should be able to input the details given by the customer and raise a 
request for move-in on behalf of the customer from the back-office portal

4.4.4.	Validation
*	Mandatory field validation must be enforced for all required inputs.
*	HHO-Company user and relevant community recipients should receive notification upon request 
creation.
*	All transactions must be recorded in the history panel
*	Form field validation should mirror the logic implemented in the mobile app.
*	System must detect and block move-in creation if any overlapping approved/pending requests 
already exist (excluding canceled/rejected).
4.4.5.	Business rule
*	Only authorized Community Admins can create HHO-Company move-in requests.
*	Move-in requests can be initiated regardless of any move-out status.
*	Requests by different users for the same unit are allowed, but only if they do not overlap in time.
*	If a user has an existing request (not cancelled/rejected) with overlapping dates, the system 
blocks creation of a new one.
*	Each move-in request should display its unique request number in all submission and status 
dialogs.
*	On approval, a pop-up must display the count of other overlapping move-in requests (excluding 
rejected/cancelled).
*	If overlapping exists, Community Admin must first manually mark previous request as ‘Move-
out’ before creating a new one.
*	System must prevent two Approved move-in requests for the same unit and date range.
*	System should not allow approval if any active move-in exists for the same unit and date range.
*	At time of physical move-in, the Move-in Permit is presented to security, who then closes the 
request, marking the unit as occupied.
4.4.6.	Processing
*	All validations and business rules must be passed before the system allows the move-in request 
to be raised.
*	If validation fails, system must display appropriate, clear error messages (e.g., “Overlapping 
request exists for same unit/date”).
*	Upon successful submission:
o	Move-in request ID is generated
o	Request becomes visible in both Admin and One App
*	On request screen open, the system should display pop-up with count and details of existing 
overlapping move-in requests.
*	A Move-in Permit must be generated immediately upon successful creation.
*	Permit details and request status should be synced across mobile and portal interfaces.

8.	Functional Specification FS-73: Account Renewal Creation from back-office portal
The Account Renewal module enables customers to extend their access to a community by submitting 
an account renewal request. This request can be initiated via the OneSobha mobile application and is 
routed to the Community Admin for review and approval.
Currently, these requests are processed through SmartFM, and upon approval, access to the respective 
unit is extended for the user (Owner, Tenant, HHO–Owner, or HHO–Company).
As per the new requirement, account renewal requests will now be managed within the OneSobha back-
office portal. Additionally, the Community Admin will have the ability to log a renewal request on behalf 
of the customer, based on the information shared by the customer.

11.	Functional Specification FS-29: Move-out Request 
The Move-Out module enables customers to formally initiate their departure from the community. The 
process ensures that unit access is revoked upon approval, maintaining operational and security 
integrity.
Customers such as Owners, Tenants, and HHO (Household Occupants) can submit Move-Out requests via 
the OneSobha mobile application. These requests are received by the Community Admin and processed 
through the OneSobha Back Office Portal.
For detailed use cases related to move-out requests from the mobile app, please refer to the functional 
specification in BRD FM-06: Move-Out:
*	FS-29: Move-Out Request Creation
o	UC-55: Move-Out Request Creation by Owner / Tenant / H
This request is processed in SmartFM and based on move-out request approval, access to unit access is 
revoked.
As per the new requirement, move-out request will be processed in OneSobha back-office portal. Along 
with this, Community Admins must be able to raise a Move-Out request on behalf of the customer from 
the back-office interface
